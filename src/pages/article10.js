            Why CPAs Need a Tech-Savvy Partner—Not Just a Marketing Agency
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            When it comes to building a strong online presence, CPAs often turn
            to digital marketing agencies. It sounds like the logical
            choice—right? After all, they handle your website, social media,
            ads, and maybe some SEO. But there&apos;s a catch: most marketing
            agencies don&apos;t understand the language of finance or the real
            workflow behind tax and accounting services.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            That&apos;s where the difference lies.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            CPAs don&apos;t just need a marketing team. They need a{" "}
            <strong>
              tech-savvy partner who truly understands their world.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-xl mt-6 font-bold">
            Most Agencies Sell. We Understand.
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            A typical agency will tell you how to “get more traffic” or “run
            Facebook ads.” But if they don&apos;t understand what a 1040 is, or
            why tax season is a crunch time, how can they market your services
            effectively?
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            As someone who&apos;s spent years in the tax industry—and now works
            with IT and digital media—I bridge both sides. I know how your busy
            season works, how client communication flows, and why efficiency
            matters just as much as branding.
          </p>

          <h1 className="text-xl mt-6 font-bold">
            We Know What CPAs Need (Even Before They Ask)
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            Most CPAs need three key things from a digital partner:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc sm:!list-disc sm:!ml-5">
            <li>
              A website that speaks your client&apos;s language (not vague
              marketing buzzwords)
            </li>
            <li>
              Tools that make your work smoother (think: digital tax organizers,
              onboarding forms, portals)
            </li>
            <li>
              A content strategy that builds trust (because your clients
              aren&apos;t looking to be sold—they&apos;re looking for answers)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            A regular agency might build you a flashy site. A tech-savvy partner
            will build you a smart one—with secure integrations, client-friendly
            features, and easy update options during tax season chaos.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-xl mt-6 font-bold">From Process to Platform</h1>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            You know how stressful it is to juggle client follow-ups, document
            requests, and return reviews. We know it too—because we&apos;ve
            lived it. That&apos;s why we don&apos;t just design things to look
            good—we design them to work for your firm&apos;s real needs.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            Whether it&apos;s helping you automate document collection,
            streamline onboarding, or schedule seasonal campaigns, we build
            systems around your workflow—not the other way around.
          </p>
          <h1 className="text-xl mt-6 font-bold">
            Long-Term Value &gt; Short-Term Clicks
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            Marketing isn&apos;t just about today&apos;s engagement. It&apos;s
            about building credibility, trust, and visibility that lasts.
            That&apos;s what clients look for in their CPA, and that&apos;s what
            your digital strategy should reflect.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            With a tech-driven partner, you&apos;re not just chasing
            trends—you&apos;re building digital assets that grow with your
            practice.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            Your firm deserves more than a pretty website or generic social
            media posts. You deserve a partner who knows why your work matters,
            and how to make that visible to the right audience—with the right
            tools.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 sm:text-justify">
            If you&apos;re a CPA or EA looking to level up your digital presence
            with someone who truly gets your industry—let&apos;s talk.
