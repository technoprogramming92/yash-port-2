          <p className="mt-6">
            When people think of a tax preparer, they often picture someone
            plugging numbers into a software program. But in reality, a tax
            preparer&apos;s role goes far beyond <strong>data entry</strong>.
            They serve as
            <strong> trusted financial guides</strong>, ensuring compliance,
            maximizing deductions, and helping individuals and businesses make
            informed tax decisions.

          <p className="mt-6">
            Let&apos;s break down the{" "}
            <strong>key responsibilities of a tax preparer</strong>—because
            it&apos;s much more than just filing forms.

              Understanding Complex Tax Laws
              <p className="mt-3">
                Tax laws change <strong>frequently</strong>, and a tax preparer
                must stay updated on:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc sm:!list-disc sm:!ml-4">
                <li>IRS regulations</li>

                <li>New deductions and credits</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A tax preparer ensures{" "}

              Gathering & Organizing Financial Information
              <p className="mt-3">
                A tax preparer helps clients collect and organize essential tax
